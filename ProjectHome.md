Syn4 is a successor to the legendary "Syn Editor for Text files".

The goals of this new project are:
  1. Make it Unicode capable
  1. Give it a multi language UI with .lng files
  1. Give it a modern UI look and feel
  1. Implement a better direct ftp editing
  1. Some improvements

To do this, we using:
  1. SynEdit component for Delphi (synedit.sf.net)
  1. Toolbar 2000 (jrsoftware.org/tb2k.php)
  1. SpTBXLib (silverpointdevelopment.com/sptbxlib/index.htm)
  1. Virtual Treeview (http://lischke-online.de/index.php/controls/virtual-treeview)
  1. Virtual ShellTools (http://code.google.com/p/mustangpeakvirtualshelltools)

Syn4 is neither a fork of the original Syn Editor nor a enhancement. It is a fully rewritten Project.

Why the name "Syn4"? Very simple. The original project has version 2.1 as latest stable release (Syn2). The next release version 3.0 (Syn3) was never accomplished and still in pre-alpha state since 2003. Im using Syn2 for many years and many projects as my favorite editor. At a point, i'm came to the decision to write a improvement. But unfortunately the public sources was incomplete and never compile. So i start a new project. In honor to the Original im calling it Syn4, but it began with version 0.1.
